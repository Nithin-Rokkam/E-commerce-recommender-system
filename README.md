Nowadays, e-commerce is becoming an essential part of business for many
reasons, including the simplicity, availability, richness, and diversity of
products and services, the flexibility of payment methods, and the convenience of
shopping remotely without losing time. These benefits have greatly optimized
the lives of users, especially with the technological development of mobile
devices and the availability of the Internet anytime and anywhere. Because of
their direct impact on the revenue of e-commerce companies, recommender
systems are considered a must in this field. Recommender systems detect
items that match the customer's needs based on the customer's previous
actions and make them appear interestingly. Such a customized experience
helps to increase customer engagement and purchase rates as the
suggested items are tailored to the customer's interests. Therefore, perfecting
recommendation systems that allow for more personalized and accurate item
recommendations is a major challenge in the e-marketing world. In our study,
we succeeded in developing a model that suggests personal recommendations
to customers using different classification algorithms. Our technique generated
good results with a high average probability of purchasing the next product
suggested by the recommendation system.
